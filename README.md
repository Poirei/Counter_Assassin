# Counter_Assassin
Initial site construct..
*************************************************************************************************************************
Hello fellow developers! Well, I currently started working on this project which is a website.Its primarily inspired by the Material design
framework of Google. I made this site solely for Counter Strike fans(and yes, I am a great fan of it too!) for providing them info. related
to event schedules, various insights of the game, tutorials and other such stuffs. The site is currently in the developing stage and there's
much work needed to be done especially implementing interactivity. So, I welcome anyone to check it out, review it and suggest better ideas 
that would improve the usability and productivity of the site even more. 
                                                         
                                                         Thank You!
